## Rough PRD
# Product Requirements Document (PRD): SpazaChain

## 1. App Overview

**Product Name:** SpazaChain  
**Target Users:** South African township spaza shop owners, suppliers/wholesalers, (optional: group leaders, admins)

**Problem Statement:**  
Spaza shops face prohibitively high purchase costs, fragmented supply chains, weak bargaining power, and chronic inefficiencies. Individual shop owners pay premium prices and have minimal negotiation leverage compared to formal retailers or pooled foreign-owner networks.

**Solution:**  
SpazaChain is a mobile-friendly, community-centric platform empowering local shops to form digital buying groups, negotiate bulk deals, and streamline group procurement‚Äîlowering costs, building trust, and boosting local business sustainability.

## 2. App Description

SpazaChain enables spaza owners to:
- Form or join group buying collectives by area
- Pool orders to reach bulk pricing thresholds
- Engage directly with suppliers for better deals
- Track group orders and payment status simply
- Collaborate with peers, building community networks

Suppliers, in turn, gain easy access to consolidated demand in local townships and can optimize delivery and business relationships.

## 3. Core App Logic

### 3.3 Bulk Order Flows
- Group leader initiates a new bulk order (product selection, deadline)
- Members join/commit individual quantities
- App aggregates total order volumes and displays price break estimates
- Order summary with split quantities and costs per shop
- Group submissions create a Request for Offer to suppliers

### 3.4 Supplier Interaction
- Suppliers register and manage product catalog (with multiple price tiers)
- View/join open group order requests and submit offers
- Negotiate and respond with best pricing/delivery options
- Group leader selects a supplier‚Äôs offer and confirms the order

### 3.5 Order Status & Tracking
- Each order moves through stages: Open ‚Üí Awaiting Supplier ‚Üí Offer Received ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Awaiting Payment ‚Üí Complete
- Users see at-a-glance status and progress
- Mock payment confirmation per member (Paid/Unpaid)
- Delivery or pickup noted at order finalization

### 3.6 Communication (Optional/Recommended)
- Group message board or chat for discussing deals and logistics
